# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tom
Welcome to my Github!  I'm currently in my 2nd year of an Integrated Masters Degree (MEng) in Computer Science at the <a href="https://southampton.ac.uk">University of Southampton</a> in the UK.  I'm also a Software Engineer at [Iceline Hosting](https://iceline-hosting.com), working on fast, user-oriented web applications and optimized internal business systems.

## A little about what I do
With over three years of web development experience, I'm proficient with a number of technologies - these include: NodeJS, PHP, React, Vue, Docker and both SQL and NoSQL database types.  In addition to this, I have gained advanced knowledge of data structures, algorithms and computing theory as part of my degree - this has also involved Java, Python and Linux assignments.  Throughout my second year, I will be expected to learn Haskell to a high level with coursework such as writing my own interpreter for a custom programming language - I am also actively learning Golang for work.  My editors of choice are IntelliJ-based IDEs and Visual Studio Code for everything else!

In my spare time you can find me out with my friends, running or even playing the occasional game.  I love being outdoors and am happiest when being social - something University has been really good for!

## Let's talk!
I am currently open to taking on freelance web development projects alongside my job this summer - if you're seeking a developer for a static site, Wordpress theme or small web app I'd love to see how I can help!  I'd be more than happy for you to reach out with the social links above or via email: tommitchelmore@outlook.com (tm7g20@southampton.ac.uk for academic enquiries)
